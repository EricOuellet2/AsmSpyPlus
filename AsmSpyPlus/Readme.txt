Hi,

This project started from AsmSpy at: https://github.com/mikehadlow/AsmSpy.
I also red usefull information at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871073/resolving-msb3247-found-conflicts-between-different-versions-of-the-same-depen.

I added a User Interface to make it easier to see/find referenced assemblies.
I hope it could help you to find problems related to innapropriate referenced dlls and/or version of them.

Eric.
